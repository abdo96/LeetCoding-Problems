1) https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version </br>
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return a bool
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 1
        r = n
        
        while l <= r:
            
            mid = (l+r) // 2
            
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                if not isBadVersion(mid-1):
                    return mid
                else:
                    r = mid - 1

2) https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/ </br>
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        
        jewels = {}

- Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
- Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.
- The order of output does not matter

```python
import collections
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        
        myDictP=collections.Counter(p)
        myDictS=collections.Counter(s[:len(p)])
        
        output=[]
        i=0
        j=len(p)
        s_length = len(s)

- Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

```python

        myDicts1=collections.Counter(s1)
        myDicts2=collections.Counter(s2[:len(s1)])
        
        i=0
        j=len(s1)
        s_length = len(s2)
        
        while j <= s_length:

                return True

            myDicts2[s2[i]]-=1
            if myDicts2[s2[i]] <= 0:
